    This builds upon this work by synthesizing and systematizing recent research into generalizability failure, generalizable methods, and polyp segmentation. This is then used to inform the development of a complete deep learning pipeline dedicated solely to ensuring maximal generalizability, consisting of a novel evaluation procedure, loss-function, model, and augmentation strategy. Each of these components and their impact on generalizability were then evaluated through an ablation study.
