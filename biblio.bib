abstract = {Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an active field in natural language processing with many successful developed models in recent years. Despite their high in-distribution accuracy, these models suffer from two issues: high training cost and low out-of-distribution accuracy. Even though some approaches have been presented to tackle the generalization problem, they have high, intolerable training costs. In this paper, we investigate the effect of ensemble learning as a light approach to improve out-of-distribution generalization of MRC systems by aggregating the outputs of some pre-trained base models without retraining a big model. After separately training the base models with different structures on different datasets, they are ensembled using weighting and stacking approaches in probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings. Three configurations are investigated including heterogeneous, homogeneous, and hybrid on eight datasets and six state-of-the-art models. We identify the important factors in the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Also, we compare the robustness of ensemble and fine-tuned models against data distribution shifts. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the ensemble approach in improving the out-of-distribution accuracy of MRC systems, especially when the base models are similar in accuracies.}

abstract="Colonoscopy is the gold standard for examination and detection of colorectal polyps. Localization and delineation of polyps can play a vital role in treatment (e.g., surgical planning) and prognostic decision making. Polyp segmentation can provide detailed boundary information for clinical analysis. Convolutional neural networks have improved the performance in colonoscopy. However, polyps usually possess various challenges, such as intra-and inter-class variation and noise. While manual labeling for polyp assessment requires time from experts and is prone to human error (e.g., missed lesions), an automated, accurate, and fast segmentation can improve the quality of delineated lesion boundaries and reduce missed rate. The Endotect challenge provides an opportunity to benchmark computer vision methods by training on the publicly available Hyperkvasir and testing on a separate unseen dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called ``DDANet'' based on a dual decoder attention network. Our experiments demonstrate that the model trained on the Kvasir-SEG dataset and tested on an unseen dataset achieves a dice coefficient of 0.7874, mIoU of 0.7010, recall of 0.7987, and a precision of 0.8577, demonstrating the generalization ability of our model.",

abstract="Domain generalizable model is attracting increasing attention in medical image analysis since data is commonly acquired from different institutes with various imaging protocols and scanners. To tackle this challenging domain generalization problem, we propose a Domain Composition and Attention-based network (DCA-Net) to improve the ability of domain representation and generalization. First, we present a domain composition method that represents one certain domain by a linear combination of a set of basis representations (i.e., a representation bank). Second, a novel plug-and-play parallel domain preceptor is proposed to learn these basis representations and we introduce a divergence constraint function to encourage the basis representations are as divergent as possible. Then, a domain attention module is proposed to learn the linear combination coefficients of the basis representations. The result of liner combination is used to calibrate the feature maps of an input image, which enables the model to generalize to different and even unseen domains. We validate our method on public prostate MRI dataset acquired from six different institutions with apparent domain shift. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generalizes well on different and even unseen domains and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the multi-domain prostate segmentation task. Code is available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/DCA-Net.",

abstract = {Chest X-ray images are used in deep convolutional neural networks for the detection of COVID-19, the greatest human challenge of the 21st century. Robustness to noise and improvement of generalization are the major challenges in designing these networks. In this paper, we introduce a strategy for data augmentation using the determination of the type and value of noise density to improve the robustness and generalization of deep CNNs for COVID-19 detection. Firstly, we present a learning-to-augment approach that generates new noisy variants of the original image data with optimized noise density. We apply a Bayesian optimization technique to control and choose the optimal noise type and its parameters. Secondly, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy, based on denoised X-ray images, that uses the distance between denoised and original pixels to generate new data. We develop an autoencoder model to create new data using denoised images corrupted by the Gaussian and impulse noise. A database of chest X-ray images, containing COVID-19 positive, healthy, and non-COVID pneumonia cases, is used to fine-tune the pre-trained networks (AlexNet, ShuffleNet, ResNet18, and GoogleNet). The proposed method performs better results compared to the state-of-the-art learning to augment strategies in terms of sensitivity (0.808), specificity (0.915), and F-Measure (0.737). The source code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/mohamadmomeny/Learning-to-augment-strategy.}

A lot of methods have been developed to tackle this problem ranging from autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, to robotics, medical research, agriculture and so on. Many of these methods have been built using the deep learning paradigm that has shown a salient performance. For this reason, we propose to survey these methods by, first categorizing them into ten different classes according to the common concepts underlying their architectures. Second, by providing an overview of the publicly available datasets on which they have been assessed. In addition, we present the common evaluation matrix used to measure their accuracy. Moreover, we focus on some of the methods and look closely at their architectures in order to find out how they have achieved their reported performances. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the open problems and their possible solutions.}

	abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence represents the process by which most, if not all,
	colorectal cancers arise. The evidence supporting this
	hypothesis has increased rapidly in recent years and the purpose
	of this article is to review this evidence critically and
	highlight its clinical significance. METHODS: Medline searches
	were used to identify recent key articles relating to the
	adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Further pertinent articles were
	obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified
	papers. RESULTS: The evidence supporting the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence can be classified as epidemiological,
	clinicopathological and genetic. The most recent and largest
	body of data relates to molecular genetic events and their
	cellular effects; however, many other approaches, such as
	cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics and cytometry, have also
	yielded valuable information. CONCLUSION: Recent work continues
	to support the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, but there is a
	paucity of data on the interrelationship between different
	genetic mutations and on the relationship between molecular and
	other types of genetic abnormalities. The clinical utility of
	the observations described has yet to be fully realized and
	global genetic analysis of colorectal tumours may prove to be
	central in rational adenoma management.",

	abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Polyp miss rates during colonoscopy
	have been calculated in a few tandem or back-to-back colonoscopy
	studies. Our objective was to assess the adenoma miss rate while
	limiting technique or operator expertise biases, i. e. by
	performing a large multicenter study, with same-day back-to-back
	video colonoscopy, done by two different operators in randomized
	order and blinded to the other examination. PATIENTS AND
	METHODS: 294 patients at 11 centers were included. Among the 286
	analyzable tandem colonoscopies, miss rates were calculated in
	both a lesion- and patient-based analysis. Each of these rates
	was determined for polyps overall, for adenomas, and then for
	lesions larger than 5 mm, and for advanced adenomas. Univariate
	and logistic regression analysis were performed to define
	independent variables associated with missed polyps or adenomas.
	RESULTS: The miss rates for polyps, adenomas, polyps > or = 5
	mm, adenomas > or = 5 mm, and advanced adenomas were,
	respectively, 28 \%, 20 \%, 12 \%, 9 \% and 11 \%. None of the
	masses with a carcinomatous (n = 3) or carcinoid component (n =
	1) was missed. The specific lesion miss rates for patients with
	polyps and adenomas were respectively 36 \% and 26 \% but the
	corresponding rates were 23 \% and 9.4 \% when calculated for
	all 286 patients. The diameter (1-mm increments) and number of
	polyps (> or = 3) were independently associated with a lower
	polyp miss rate, whereas sessile or flat shape and left location
	were significantly associated with a higher miss rate. Adequacy
	of cleansing, presence of diverticula, and duration of
	withdrawal for the first procedure were not associated with
	adenoma miss rate. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a significant miss
	rate for polyps or adenoma during colonoscopy. Detection of flat
	polyps is an issue that must be focused on to improve the
	quality of colonoscopy.",

	the same or different position. RESULTS: The overall miss rate

	with two or more adenomas at the first examination were more
	likely than patients with no or one adenoma detected at the
	first examination to have one or more adenomas at the second
	examination (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% confidence interval,
	1.69-6.46). Right colon adenomas were missed more often (27\%)

Through extensive experimentation, we explore several possible   explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a   regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009) and as an aid to optimization   (Bengio et al. 2007).  Our results build on the work of   Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to   play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised   training. However our results in an online setting, with a virtually unlimited   data stream, point to a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of the roles   of optimization and regularization in the unsupervised pre-training   effect.},

  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

  abstract = 	 {Current neural network-based classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples even in the black-box setting, where the attacker only has query access to the model. In practice, the threat model for real-world systems is often more restrictive than the typical black-box model where the adversary can observe the full output of the network on arbitrarily many chosen inputs. We define three realistic threat models that more accurately characterize many real-world classifiers: the query-limited setting, the partial-information setting, and the label-only setting. We develop new attacks that fool classifiers under these more restrictive threat models, where previous methods would be impractical or ineffective. We demonstrate that our methods are effective against an ImageNet classifier under our proposed threat models. We also demonstrate a targeted black-box attack against a commercial classifier, overcoming the challenges of limited query access, partial information, and other practical issues to break the Google Cloud Vision API.}

Despite near expert-label performance with the application of the deep learning method in medical image segmentation, the generalization of such models in the clinical environment remains a significant challenge. Transfer learning from a large medical dataset from the same domain is a common technique to address generalizability. However, it is difficult to find a similar large medical dataset. To address generalizability in polyp segmentation, we have used an ensemble of four MultiResUNet architectures, each trained on the combination of the different centered datasets provided by the challenge organizers. Our method achieved a decent performance of 0.6172 {\textpm} 0.0778 for the multi-centered dataset. Our study shows that significant work needs to be done to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system to detect and localize polyp of the multi-center datasets, which is essential for improving the quality of the colonoscopy.},
